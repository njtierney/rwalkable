# rwalkable

The goal of rwalkable is to look up and summarise some information about the walkability of a neighbourhood.  We look at two components of walkability: 

- how many places are there within walking distance that you might want to go to?
- is there a reasonably dense network of roads or paths to walk on.

We use data from OpenStreetMap for both components: it provides both a road network and a list of locations ('amenities') that someone has thought worth adding to the map.
